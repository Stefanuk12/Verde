# Verde

![Verde Logo](extension/logo_small.png)

A Roblox Studio + Properties Emulator VS Code extension.

Verde allows to view your entire datamodel from within VS Code, with operations like copy, paste, duplicate, rename, and delete for any instance.

Verde also comes with a properties window, allowing you to read and modify any properties of any instance without having to leave your editor.

Verde can be used either with a dedicated sync tool (Like Rojo/Argon/Azul) or with the newly released Script Sync + [Luau-LSP](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp) (for sourcemap generation)

## Features

- **Live Instance Tree**: View your Roblox game's instance hierarchy in VS Code
- **Script Opening**: Double-click scripts from the explorer to open them right in VS Code (works with Rojo/Argon/Azul/Luau-LSP sourcemaps)
- **Instance Operations**: Rename, duplicate, delete, copy, and paste instances
- **Properties Panel**: View and edit instance properties right from VS Code
